# Clock In / Clock Out Desktop App

## FEATURES
- calculates how many hours worked each day and week
- Saves csv of hours to your machine so you can reference in the future
- if you forget to click login/logout you can manually change your hours for the week


## TODO
  - take [ms, ms] times per day and render them as form inputs
  - convert HH:MM to ms date and save them back into the [ms, ms]
  - add leading 0 to times like 9:3
  - convert 24hour times into 12hr AM/PM

  - midnight happens: auto clock out (can put this logic in interval)
  - user closes app without logging out
    - before close:
      - if clockedIn
        - clockOut User

## NICE TO HAVES
  - let user choose location of where save
